# Project Status

## Current Work

No implementation subtask is active. Owner accepted and closed T99 S37.
Open task awaiting owner: T99. No next S is admitted. The next unused S identifier is S38.
See [S37 closure](../history/M9-T99-S37-original-device-audit.md).

## Current Technical Baseline

S37 deliveries 7a77c818 and fd87c1bd are owner-accepted. BIOS permissions,
slave EOI, virtual CRTC text height and full-width ROM fallback reads are
repaired in the existing paths. PIC and keyboard retain their tested behavior.
Both EXEs are published; x86/x64 each pass 187 background and eight native
cases (390 total), including recorded connected-session native reruns.
See [S37 evidence](../etc/evidence/softpc/m9-t99-s37-original-device-audit.md).

Public eight trees are unchanged by S36/S37; S34's imported baseline remains
intact. This is not a fresh comparison with NXVM's current worktree. S35 was
withdrawn without a code delivery. Three independent C-VID findings remain in
[TODO](TODO.md); no new S is allocated for them. The runtime-performance
candidate remains in [Queue](QUEUE.md). T99 still needs its overall completion
audit and owner-approved closure.

## Recent Governance

Task scratch is removed; reusable Ninja/ccache roots remain. Follow existing
build-cache and task-owned probe cleanup rules.
