# Project Status

## Current Work

No implementation task is active. M8 T19 closed the auditable source-mirror
migration; its result and verification are recorded in
[M8 T19](../history/M8-T19-transitional-layout-removal-and-proof.md).

## Current Technical Baseline

- The fixed standalone package is `artifacts/binary/softpc32.exe` and
  `softpc64.exe`, with adjacent `softpc.ini` and guest media below
  `artifacts/media/`.
- M8 T19 completes the source layout as `src/{mvdm,overlay,host,app}` and
  removes transitional `src/core` and `src/vm` routes. Fresh GCC x64/x86
  builds each passed full CTest, 20/20.
- The selected original ROM inputs are byte-identical to OpenNT and embedded
  from `src/mvdm/softpc.new/roms/`; no runtime ROM artifact root is active.

## Recent Governance

- M8 Td S1 established the NXVM-style authority topology, linked the four
  applicable shared governance skills, and added the documentation gate.
- M8 Td S2 established the public product identity as Insignia SoftPC and
  added current, owner-provided SoftPC product captures to the root README.
- M8 T14 established a deterministic, 1,222-row source-map against the
  selected OpenNT revision. It found 60 direct differences and assigned every
  one a future overlay, host, or removal disposition without altering code.
- Implementation task identifiers are repository-wide build versions: the
  12 historical tasks end at T12 and M8 completes at T19. Td governance work
  does not consume a build-version number.
