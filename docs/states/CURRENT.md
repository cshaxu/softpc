# Project Status

## Current Work

No implementation subtask is active. The ordered candidate queue is in
[Queue](QUEUE.md).

## Current Technical Baseline

- Source: T68 is closed. The preserved Scan-1 table mapper rejects both first
  out-of-range input values without changing valid key mappings. No Lib,
  Common, App, VM, Compat interface or input behavior changed.
- Both widths have 107 passing test cases; package EXEs were refreshed without
  changing owner INI/media. See [T65 audit](../history/M9-T65-completion-audit.md).
- Snapshots are width-independent fixed-order binary streams with no magic,
  version or section identifier. They restore CPU/device/media state into a
  normal PAUSED machine; Window creation remains deferred until resume.
- `save` accepts RUNNING or PAUSED. A paused save writes an already-held VM
  checkpoint directly, or privately advances the existing executor to one
  while the product remains PAUSED and guest input stays gated.
- DIRECT/READONLY media retain and verify their external references; FDD/HDD
  OVERLAY effective differences and cylinder state are in the same binary.
- T63 snapshot behavior remains the owner-accepted baseline. Current package
  EXEs include T67; the owner’s current package INI edit ships with T67.

## Recent Governance

T68 closes the bounded original keyboard-table safety repair. T67's independent
media-policy ledger remains recorded in its T-level audit.
