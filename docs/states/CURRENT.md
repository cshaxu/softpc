# Project Status

## Current Work

No implementation subtask is active.
Open task awaiting owner: T70.

M9 T70 S7 is closed with owner approval. T70 remains open, awaiting the
owner's next instruction; no next S is admitted. See the
[S7 closure](../history/M9-T70-S7-stack-width-repair.md) and
[retained proposal](../history/M9-T70-hardware-detection-proposal.md).

## Current Technical Baseline

- T70 implementation delivery `ce5f535` fixes the CCPU privilege-changing
  stack-load width using the existing SS-based helper in CALL, IRET and RETF.
  Owner confirmed that the supplied checkpoint passes Win95 hardware detection.
- The same delivery includes the bounded S2--S6 controller/PIC, SAS allocation,
  TLS setjmp and restored-continuation repairs; their distinct evidence is in
  the [investigation record](../history/M9-T70-S6-investigation-record.md).
- Both x86/x64 package EXEs are rebuilt. Non-integration tests pass 105/105
  on each width; focused checkpoint/snapshot/IRQ/BOP tests pass 4/4 each.
  Two package Window integration tests failed at Window observation; their
  cause remains unproven. Owner approved S7 closure with this disclosed limit
  and successful hardware-detection acceptance. No full-suite pass is claimed.
- Lib/Common, user INI and guest media are unchanged. Snapshots retain their
  width-independent format and existing media semantics; restoring a snapshot
  parks its exact continuation before another guest instruction executes.
- T69's accepted Compat display transaction, packed-painter width and text
  surface corrections remain. The nonreproducible native Window-height report
  remains in TODO; the later Win95 memory warning is not diagnosed by S7.

## Recent M9 Closures

| Task | Closure | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T69 | S1--S4 complete; owner-reopened cleanup removed its own obsolete code. | [Audit](../history/M9-T69-completion-audit.md) |
| T68 | S1 complete; owner-directed safety repair; final dual-width 107/107. | [Audit](../history/M9-T68-completion-audit.md) |
| T67 | S1--S4 complete; owner accepted; final dual-width 107/107. | [Audit](../history/M9-T67-completion-audit.md) |
| T66 | S1--S4 complete; owner-validated dual-width package. | [Audit](../history/M9-T66-completion-audit.md) |
| T65 | S1 complete; request-slot refactor cancelled after contract audit; dual-width 107/107. | [Audit](../history/M9-T65-completion-audit.md) |
| T64 | S1 audit accepted; S2 narrowed frame copy verified; owner accepted. | [Audit](../history/M9-T64-completion-audit.md) |

## Recent Governance

T70 S7 closes after the owner confirmed hardware-detection success and approved
commit/push. The T-level task is explicitly open; queue order is unchanged.
