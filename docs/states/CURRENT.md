# Project Status

## Current Work

No implementation subtask is active. Owner accepts and closes M9 T99 S42.
Open task awaiting owner: T99.
No next S is admitted.
See [S42 closure](../history/M9-T99-S42-unused-mirror-retirement.md).

## Current Technical Baseline

S42 final implementation 60bdbaa4 removes unused mouse_io.c, nop.c, vglob.c
and their obsolete wiring/state. Both published EXEs pass 392/392 tests.
Snapshots now use SCP3; older SCP2 files are rejected without compatibility.
The retained mirror has 472 files. User media/configuration are preserved;
a separately modified assets/binary/snapshot is outside this closure commit.


S41 delivery ecf263a8 completes the five admitted mirror cleanup/guard units:
production +16/-29, with XP mirror added+deleted diff reduced by 13 lines.
Snapshot command IDs and the existing device paths remain unchanged.
See [S41 closure](../history/M9-T99-S41-mirror-cleanup.md).

Td S23 delivery db76bb60 repairs the cached compiler timestamp, updates
execution rules and verifies embedded EXE literals. Both architectures pass
188 background plus eight native tests each: 392/392. Published EXEs carry
Nov 8 timestamps. See [timestamp closure](../history/M9-Td-S23-build-timestamp.md).
Only Emulator build configuration/verifier/manifest changed within the public
eight trees; no fresh NXVM alignment is claimed.

[TODO](TODO.md) has no deferred entries. The runtime-performance candidate
remains in [Queue](QUEUE.md). T99 still requires its overall completion audit
and owner-approved closure.

## Recent Governance

[Td S23 timestamp governance](../history/M9-Td-S23-build-timestamp.md) is closed.
Task scratch is removed; reusable Ninja/ccache roots remain. Follow existing
build-cache and task-owned probe cleanup rules.
