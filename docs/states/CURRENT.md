# Project Status

## Current Work

M9 T77 S1 is active: product test inventory and ownership relocation.
Owner accepted T76 testing and requested closure and admission of the next
queued task. T76 is closed; implementation baseline remains 7ebb435f.
[T77 brief and plan](../proposals/m9-product-test-layout-cleanup.md).

## Current Technical Baseline

- T76 uses one direct page-pointer array for Storage overlay lookup; no public
  API or snapshot format change. Production +39/-30 (net +9); tests +89/-2
  (net +87). No benchmark per owner direction; array memory scales with capacity.
  Final Release/background x64 110/110 (146.29s), x86 110/110 (146.52s), five
  desktop cases excluded per width. Old/new x86/x64 snapshot matrix 16/16 passes;
  golden media payload matches old linked-list codec on both widths. Artifacts
  and hashes are recorded in the archived T76 proposal; INI/media unchanged.
- T75 uses the existing task cancellation object for the outer Machine wait;
  deterministic lost-command-wake coverage and repeated native shutdown pass.
  All six shared packages select strict C11 in standalone and embedded builds.
  Public API, App/Core, INI and media remain unchanged. Endpoint source/test/build
  +126/-79 (net +47), of which production C/H is +34/-33 (net +1).
- T75 S4 verifies sixteen independent four/six-package builds on both widths;
  each width passes isolated Lib 41/41, Common 18/18, and optional x86 9/9.
  All 180/204 copied files remain identical. Final product background x64
  110/110 (127.19s), x86 110/110 (182.23s); both Release EXEs rebuilt and match
  S3 hashes. Desktop cases excluded; no Linux runtime or NNES integration claim.
- T74 S1 moves 556 files into src/core/{machine,compat,softpc.new}.
  498 mirror blobs are identical; 107 product/test C/H/RC files pass path-only
  comparison. Runtime symbols and behavior remain unchanged. Both Release
  builds and background suites pass: x64 110/110 (165.45s), x86 110/110
  (157.47s); five desktop cases excluded per width. Shared corpora, INI and
  guest media are untouched. [T74 proposal](../history/M9-T74-core-layout-rename-proposal.md)
  holds the +421/-409 (net +12) source/test/build/tool ledger and EXE hashes.
- Accepted T73 implementation 879c30ac, actual-change review ad665a86.
  Owner manual S5 testing passed. Closure changes documents only.
- Shared source corpora are src/lib, src/common, src/x86; matching suites are
  test/lib, test/common, test/x86. The six-directory set serves x86 products;
  the four Lib/Common directories build/test with x86 absent.
- Common contains machine/session/ui only. Machine retains one executor and
  copied opaque 128/1536-byte debug transport with its existing paused lease.
  x86/debug owns CPU protocol and DOS/X CLI; x86/xasm32 owns assembly/disassembly.
  VM validates x86 requests; App explicitly connects optional x86 capabilities.
- Lib and test/lib are unchanged by T73. Host-PC key identity and existing KVM
  capacities are retained; receiving adapters own guest input mapping.
- Final background x64 110/110 (181.72s), x86 110/110 (165.87s); both Release
  builds passed. Five desktop cases per width were excluded. Native Common/x86
  tests each passed 50 repetitions per width. Owner testing does not imply
  those excluded automated cases or Linux/NEC integration were exercised.
- Isolated neutral copy: Lib 41/41, Common 18/18. Isolated six-directory copy:
  Lib 41/41, Common 18/18, x86 9/9. No product resources/build are required.
- T73 endpoint C/H production +487/-428 (net +59), tests +1104/-819 (net +285);
  complete ledger and artifact hashes are in the completion audit. S5 runtime
  code is unchanged; its EXEs remain byte-identical to accepted S4.
- VM owns character mapping and device-attribute decoding. KVM uses four-byte
  text cells; Window owns fonts and Console owns character maps. Base transports
  opaque control FIFO and latest-wins frames. Window compares decoded pixels
  against its own surface; native relative/absolute mouse records remain.
- Common Session/UI, Compat, MVDM, snapshot format, user INI and media were not
  changed by T73. T75 S2 subsequently repairs the debug-close/paused-destroy
  wake race; its bounded schedule proof does not certify all interleavings.
- TODO remains empty under the owner's tracking policy, not proof of universal
  correctness. Queue candidates are unadmitted.

## Recent M9 Closures

| Task | Closure | Evidence |

## Recent Governance

- T76 closure archives its proposal and verifies scope, hashes and full-task
  coverage. Owner admits queue head as T77 S1; this handoff changes docs only.
- T74 closure archives the proposal and records S1/T-level requirement coverage,
  actual-change review and owner acceptance. Sources and tested EXEs unchanged.
- T73 closure records S5 acceptance, all-S requirement/changed-path audit and
  the separate queued wake-race receiver, and archives its proposal. No new
  implementation task or T number is allocated.
- M9 Td S18: T71 closure, TODO retirement and floppy-identification candidate;
  [record](../history/M9-Td-S18-t71-closure-and-floppy-queue.md).

## M9 T77 S1 Packet

| Field | Required record |
| --- | --- |
| Identifier Mode | New |
| Admission And Approval | Owner: "测试通过 收口提交t任务 准入下一个"; next queued product-test cleanup admitted after T76 closure. |
| Objective | Freeze product test inventory and relocate by App/Core/integration ownership without changing assertions or execution paths. |
| Non-goals | No production edits, shared six-directory corpus edits, runtime fixes, new fixture framework, weakened tests or guest data changes. |
| Reference Baseline | 7ebb435f accepted T76; x86/x64 background 110/110, five desktop exclusions per width. |
| Candidate Proposal | [Product test ownership plan](../proposals/m9-product-test-layout-cleanup.md) |
| Files And ABI Surface | test/unit, test/support and existing test/integration inventory; relocation destinations test/app, test/core, test/integration; root CMake and live path references. No production ABI. |
| Applicable Rules | docs/README.md reading set; EXECUTION and DOCUMENT; design ARCHITECTURE/CODING and rules ARCHITECTURE/CODING before build/code changes. |
| Verification | Freeze file/target/CTest-name and label ledger; rename-aware assertion/body comparison; live-path scan; documentation and boundary gates; x86/x64 Release builds and full background suites. |
| Expected Markers | No lost tests or changed assertion behavior; unchanged shared corpora; both background suites pass; five desktop exclusions retained. |
| Asset Needs | No guest data changes; only refresh two package EXEs at delivery. Disposable test outputs remain under owned build children, excluding build/output. |
| Reporting Requirements | Before movement report classified files/moved lines and estimated additions/deletions; after report actual rename-aware counts, test inventory, builds/tests, dual EXE links and pushed P. |
| Stop Conditions | Production/shared changes needed, unique coverage would be lost, or an unexplained test failure; diagnose without widening scope or dropping assertions. |
| Exit Criteria | Complete per-file S1 disposition; relocated tests verified with equivalent coverage, no duplicate/stale S1 paths; pushed complete delivery and actual-change review. S2/S3 remain later stages. |
| Original Owner Request | "测试通过 收口提交t任务 准入下一个"; queued request: organize confusing product test/unit and test/support ownership. |
| Similar-Issue Sweep | Enumerate all product test source, fixture includes, CMake registrations and live documentation/tool paths; assign every hit an owner and S1/S2/S3 disposition in the proposal ledger. |
