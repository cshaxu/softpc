# Project Status

## Current Work

No active task.

## Current Technical Baseline

- The fixed standalone package is `artifacts/binary/softpc32.exe` and
  `softpc64.exe`, with adjacent `softpc.ini` and guest media below
  `artifacts/media/`.
- M8 T13 separates `test/unit`, `test/integration`, and `test/support`; clean
  GCC x64/x86 CTest was 19/19 for each host width.
- The selected original ROM inputs are byte-identical to OpenNT and embedded
  from `src/mvdm/softpc.new/roms/`; no runtime ROM artifact root is active.

## Recent Governance

- M8 Td S1 established the NXVM-style authority topology, linked the four
  applicable shared governance skills, and added the documentation gate.
- M8 Td S2 established the public product identity as Insignia SoftPC and
  added current, owner-provided SoftPC product captures to the root README.
- M8 T14 established a deterministic, 1,222-row source-map against the
  selected OpenNT revision. It found 60 direct differences and assigned every
  one a future overlay, host, or removal disposition without altering code.
- Implementation task identifiers are repository-wide build versions: the
  12 historical tasks end at T12, the completed test-boundary work is M8 T13,
  and the queued work begins with M8 T14. Td governance work does not consume
  a build-version number.
