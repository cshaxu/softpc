# Project Status

## Current Work

M9 T70 is closed by owner approval after S1--S12 and the
[T-level completion audit](../history/M9-T70-completion-audit.md).
No implementation subtask is active. The queue head remains unadmitted.

## Current Technical Baseline

- Latest implementation: `8cb23e9`; S12 closure: `f6ab0dc`.
  Both package EXEs are unchanged from that delivery; final x86/x64 full
  regression passes 109/109 each, including package and snapshot checks.
- Owner accepted Win95 hardware detection, installation/desktop, display and
  Window mouse repairs. Snapshot restore uses saved media paths/modes and
  reopens all attached slots. Detailed evidence is in the T70 audit above.
- S12 retains failed-join resources, stabilizes integer geometry, uses Linux
  per-open locks and consolidates startup cleanup. Linux-native lock tests
  remain unexecuted; controlled tests do not establish native Linux behavior.
- Existing TODOs and the new queued text/frame contract proposal remain
  separately scoped; no whole-emulator or whole-Lib correctness claim.

## Recent M9 Closures

| Task | Closure | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T70 | S1--S12 complete; owner approved T closure; final dual-width 109/109, disclosed Linux limit. | [Audit](../history/M9-T70-completion-audit.md) |
| T69 | S1--S4 complete; owner-reopened cleanup removed its own obsolete code. | [Audit](../history/M9-T69-completion-audit.md) |
| T68 | S1 complete; owner-directed safety repair; final dual-width 107/107. | [Audit](../history/M9-T68-completion-audit.md) |
| T67 | S1--S4 complete; owner accepted; final dual-width 107/107. | [Audit](../history/M9-T67-completion-audit.md) |
| T66 | S1--S4 complete; owner-validated dual-width package. | [Audit](../history/M9-T66-completion-audit.md) |
| T65 | S1 complete; request-slot refactor cancelled after contract audit; dual-width 107/107. | [Audit](../history/M9-T65-completion-audit.md) |
| T64 | S1 audit accepted; S2 narrowed frame copy verified; owner accepted. | [Audit](../history/M9-T64-completion-audit.md) |

## Recent Governance

T70 is closed by owner approval; no next implementation task is admitted.

- **M9 Td S17:** Owner requested a concrete KVM text/frame correction proposal
  at queue head. Recorded capability rejection, explicit character/glyph
  semantics, bounded layout, migration batches and verification; no source or
  artifact changes. [Proposal](../proposals/m9-kvm-text-frame-contract.md).
  Documentation checks and actual-change review pass. At that delivery T70 remained open; the
  candidate is not implementation admission.
